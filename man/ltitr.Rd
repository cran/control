\title{Time response of a Linear Time-Invariant system}
\usage{
ltitr(a, b, u, x0)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{An n x n matrix of the state-space system}

\item{b}{An n x m matrix of the state-space system}

\item{u}{A row vector for single input systems. The input U must have as many rows as there are inputs
in the system. Each column of U corresponds to a new time point. \code{u} could be generated using a signal generator
like \code{gensig}}

\item{x0}{a vector of initial conditions with as many rows as the rows of \code{a}}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix X which has as
many rows as there are outputs y (and with \code{max(dim(U))} columns).
}
\description{
\code{ltitr} Computes the time response of a Linear Time-Invariant system
}
\details{
\code{ltitr} computes the time response of a Linear Time-Invariant system in state-space representation of the form:
 x[n+1] = Ax[n] + Bu[n] to an input, \code{U}

\code{ltitr(a, b, u)} computes the time response with zero-initial conditions since x0 is not supplied.
}
\examples{

A <- diag(1, 2)
B <- rbind(1, 1)
x0 <- rbind(-1, -2)
u <- cbind(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
X <- ltitr(A, B, u)
X <- ltitr(A, B, u, x0)

A <- replicate(6, abs(rnorm(6)))
B <- replicate(3, abs(rnorm(6)))
U <- replicate(100, rnorm(3))
x0 <-  rnorm(6)
X <- ltitr(A, B, U)
X <- ltitr(A, B, U, x0)
